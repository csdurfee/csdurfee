<h1>Streaks</h1>
<p>When I'm watching a basketball game, sometimes it seems like a certain player just can't miss. Every shot looks like it's going to go in. Other times, it seems like they've gone cold. They can't get a shot to go in no matter what they do. </p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as the "hot hand" and whether it exists or not has been debated for decades, even as it's taken for granted in the common language around sports. We're used to commentators saying that a player is  "heating up", or, "that was a heat check".</p>
<p>As a fan of the game, it certainly seems like the hot hand exists. If you follow basketball, some names probably come to mind. JR Smith, Danny Green, Dion Waiters, Jamal Crawford. When they're on, they just can't miss.</p>
<p>It's a thing we collectively believe in, but it turns out that there isn't strong statistical evidence to support the notion.</p>
<p>We have to be careful with our feelings about the hot hand. It certainly feels real, but that doesn't mean that it is. Within the drama of a basketball game, we're more likely to notice and assign stories to runs of makes or misses. Just because we notice them, that doesn't mean they're significant. This is sometimes called "the law of small numbers" -- our brains are very good at drawing spurious conclusions from a very small amount of data.</p>
<h2>A Thought Experiment</h2>
<p>Imagine I asked you to randomly write a sequence of "W"'s and "L"'s to simulate a team's win-loss record. I could probably tell that it was fake. You might get the winning percentage correct, but your results would probably be less "streaky" than an actual sequence of winners. Writer <a href="https://www.football-data.co.uk/blog/Wald_Wolfowitz.php">Joseph Buchdal</a> found that he couldn't create a win-loss record by hand that would fool a statistical test called the Wald-Wolfowitz test, even though he knew exactly how the statistical test works.</p>
<p>Streaks of wins and losses in randomly generated data follow regular mathematical laws, ones our brains don't want to follow when asked to do the exercise. At some level, we're physically incapable of generating truly random data, so it makes sense to me that our intuitions about randomness are a little off. Our brains are wired to notice the streaks, but we seem to have no such circuitry for noticing when something is a little bit too un-streaky. Our brains are too quick to see meaningless patterns in small amounts of data, and not clever enough to see subtle, meaningful patterns in large amounts of data. Good thing we have statistics to help us escape those biases!</p>
<h2>Defining Streakiness</h2>
<p>For the sake of this discussion, a streak starts whenever a sequence of outcomes changes from wins (W) to losses (L), or vice-versa. (I'm talking about makes and misses, but those start with the same letter, so I'll use "W" and "L".)</p>
<p>The sequence "WLWLWL" has 6 streaks: <code>W, L, W, L, W, L</code>      <br>
The sequence "WWLLLW" has 3 streaks: <code>WW, LLL, W</code></p>
<p>If I asked you to make up a random-looking string of 3 W's and 3 L's, which one is more likely to be your answer?</p>
<p>If they were making the results up, I think the average person would be more likely to write the first string. It just looks "more random", right? </p>
<p>If they flipped a coin, it would be more likely to produce something with longer streaks, like the second example. With a fair coin, both of those <em>exact</em> sequences are equally likely to occur. But the second sequence has a more probable number of streaks, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wald%E2%80%93Wolfowitz_runs_test">Wald-Wolfowitz Runs Test</a>. The expected number of streaks in 3 wins and 3 losses is (2 * (3 * 3) / (3+3)) + 1 = 4.</p>
<p>That number is equal to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean">harmonic mean</a> of the number of wins and the number of losses, plus one. I don't think there's any deep mathematical reason why that's true, just how the algebra shakes out. But it's still kinda neat, and an easy way to remember it.</p>
<p>Around 500 players attempted a shot in the NBA this season. Let's say we create a custom coin for each player. It comes up heads with the same percentage as the player's shooting percentage on the season. If we took those coins and simulated every shot in the NBA this season, some of the coins would inevitably appear to be "streakier" than others, right?</p>
<p>Players never intend to miss shots, yet most players shoot around 50%, so there has to be some element of chance as far as which shots go in or not. Otherwise, why wouldn't players choose to make all of them?</p>
<p>So shooting results are at least somewhat random, which means if we look at the shooting records of 500 players in an NBA season, some will seem more or less consistent due to the laws of statistics. That means a player with longer or shorter streaks than expected could just be due to chance, not due to the player actively doing something that makes them more streaky.</p>
<p>We might call players who have fewer streaks than expected by chance <em>consistent</em>. Maybe they go exactly 5 for 10 every single game, never being especially good or especially bad. Or maybe they go 1 for 3 every game, always being pretty bad.</p>
<p>But that feels like the wrong word, and I don't think our brains aren't really wired to notice a player that has fewer streaks than average. As we already saw, the "right" number of streaks is counterintuitive. </p>
<p>I might notice a player is unusually consistent after the fact when looking at their basketball-reference page, but the feeling of a player having the <em>hot hand</em> is visceral, experienced in the moment. Even without consulting the box score, sometimes players look like they just can't miss, or can't make, a shot. They seem more confident, or their shot seems more natural, than usual. Both the shooter and the spectator seem to have a higher expectation that the shot will go in than usual. The hot hand is a social phenomenon.</p>
<p>The heart of the question is whether players are basically just random number generators or not. (Of course, there's an <a href="https://xkcd.com/904/">xkcd about that</a>). If we look at the makes and misses of every player in the league, do they look like the results of flipping a coin (weighted to match their shooting percentage), or is there a tendency for players to be more or less streaky than expected by chance? </p>
<p>I'm going to call the opposite of the <em>hot hand</em> the <em>lukewarm hand</em>. While the <em>lukewarm hand</em> isn't a thing we would viscerally notice the way we do the <em>hot hand</em>, it's certainly possible to exist. And it's just as surprising, from the perspective of treating basketball players like weighted coins. Some people I've seen analyze the hot hand treat it as <em>streaky</em> versus <em>non-streaky</em>. But it's not a binary thing. There are two possible extremes, and a region in between. It's <em>unusually streaky</em> versus <em>normal amount of streaky</em> versus <em>unusually non-streaky</em>.</p>
<p>The Wald-Wolfowitz test says that the number of streaks in randomly-generated data will be normally distributed, and gives a formula for the variance of the number of streaks. The normal distribution is symmetrical, so there should be as many <em>hot hand</em> players as <em>lukewarm hand</em> ones. Players have varying numbers of shots taken over the course of the season so we can't compare them directly, but we can calculate the z score for each player's expected vs. actual number of streaks. The z score represents how "weird" the player is. If we look at all the z-scores together, we can see whether NBA players as a whole are streakier or less streaky than chance alone would predict.</p>
<h2>Simplifying Assumptions</h2>
<p>We should start with the assumption that athletes really are weighted random number generators. A coin might have "good days" and "bad days" based on the results, but it's not because the coin is "in the zone" one day, or a little injured the next day. At least some of the variance in a player's streakiness is due to randomness, so we have to be looking for effects that can't be explained by randomness alone.</p>
<p>So I am analyzing all shots a player took, across all games. This could cause problems, which I will discuss later on, but splitting the results up game-by-game or week-by-week leads to other problems. Looking at shooting percentages by game or by week means more sampling error. It also means that comparisions between high volume shooters and low volume shooters can be misinterpreted. The high volume shooters may appear more "consistent" simply because it's a larger sample size.</p>
<p>I think I need to prove that <em>streakiness</em> exists before making assumptions about how it works. Let's say the "hot hand" does exist. If a player makes a bunch of shots in a row, how long might they stay hot? Does it last through halftime? Does it carry over to the next game? How many makes in a row before they "heat up"? How much does a player's field goal percentage go up? Does a player have cold streaks and hot streaks, or just one of them?</p>
<p>There are an infinite number of ways to model how it could work, which means it's ripe for overfitting. So I wanted to start with the simplest, most easily justifiable model. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0010028585900106?via%3Dihub">original paper about the hot hand</a> was co-written by Amos Tversky, who won a Nobel Prize. I figure any time you can copy off of a Nobel Prize winner's homework, you probably should!</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I started off by getting data on every shot taken in the 2024-25 NBA regular season. I calculated the expected number of streaks and actual number, then a z-score for every player.</p>
<p>Players with a z-score of 0 are just like what we'd expect from flipping a coin. A positive z-score indicates there were more streaks than expected. More streaks than expected means they were shorter than expected, which means less streaky than expected. </p>
<p>A negative z-score indicates the opposite. Those players had fewer streaks than expected, which means the streaks were longer.  When people talk about the "hot hand" or "streaky shooters", they are talking about players who would have a negative z-score by this test.</p>
<p><img alt="all players, 2024-5" src="/img/all-players-2024.png"></p>
<p>The bell curve over the top is the distribution of z-scores we'd expect if players worked like weighted coin flips. </p>
<p>Just eyeballing it, it's pretty close. It's definitely a bell curve, centered pretty close to zero. If there is a skew, it's actually to the positive, un-streaky side.  The mean z-score is .21, when we'd expect it to be zero.</p>

<p>The Wilk-Shapiro test is way to decide whether a set of data plausibly came from a normal distribution. It passed. There is no conclusive evidence that players in general are streakier or less streaky than predicted by chance. This data very well could've come from flipping a bunch of coins.</p>
<p>But it's still sorta skewed, and that bothered me. There were 320 players with a positive z-score (un-streaky) versus 232 with a negative z-score (streaky).</p>
<h2>Outliers</h2>
<p>A whole lot of those 554 players didn't make that many shots.  </p>
<p><img alt="numer of makes, 2024-5" src="/img/makes-2024.png"></p>
<p>I decided to split up players with over 100 makes versus under 100 makes. Surprisingly, the low volume shooters were actually more normally distributed than the high volume shooters.  The high volume shooters had more of a bias towards un-streakiness.</p>
<p>Here are just the high volume shooters (323 players in total). Notice how none of them have a z-score less than about -2. The histogram should be symmetrical.</p>
<p><img alt="over 100 makes, 2024-5" src="/img/over-100-makes.png"></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>count    323.000000

max        3.054836
</code></pre></div>

<p>There were 20 players with a z-score less than -2 versus only 2 players with a score greater than 2.</p>
<h2>The Eye Test</h2>
<p>I looked at which players had exceptionally high or low z scores. It didn't really make sense to me as an NBA fan. There were players like Jordan Poole and Jalen Green, who are known among fans for being streaky, but they had exceptionally un-streaky z-scores. I don't think the average NBA fan would say Jalen Green is less streaky than 97.5% of the players in the league, but he is.</p>
<p>On the other hand, two streakiest players in the NBA this year were Goga Bitadze and Thomas Bryant, two players who don't fit the profile of the stereotypical streaky shooter by any means.</p>
<h2>Makes vs. Streakiness</h2>
<p>The more shots a player made this season, the less streaky they tended to be. Here's a plot of number of makes on the season versus the z-score.</p>
