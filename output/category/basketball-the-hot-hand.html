<p>(The code used, and a fuller investigation of the data is available on my github at https://github.com/csdurfee/hot_hand.)</p>
<h1>Streaks</h1>
<p>When I'm watching a basketball game, sometimes it seems like a certain player just can't miss a shot. Every shot looks like it's going to go in. Other times, it seems like they just can't make a shot. This phenomenon is known as the "hot hand" and whether it exists or not has been debated for decades, even as it's taken for granted in the common language around sports. Announcers will say that a player is  "heating up", or, "that was a heat check".</p>
<p>As a fan of the game, it certainly seems like the hot hand exists, at least for some players. If you follow basketball, some names probably come to mind. JR Smith, Danny Green, Dion Waiters, Jamal Crawford. Sometimes it seems like those guys just couldn't miss. </p>
<p>It's a thing we collectively believe in, but when subject to rigorous statistical analysis, the hot hand doesn't seem to exist. At the very least, it's been the subject of debate for a long time.</p>
<p>We have to be careful with our feelings about the hot hand. It certainly feels real, but that doesn't mean that it is. Within the drama of a basketball game, we're more likely to notice and assign stories to runs of makes or misses. Just because we notice them, that doesn't mean they're significant. This is sometimes called "the law of small numbers" -- our brains are very good at generalization from a small amount of data.</p>
<h2>A Thought Experiment</h2>
<p>Imagine I asked you to try and randomly write a sequence of "W"'s and "L"'s to simulate a team's win-loss record. I could probably tell that it was fake. You might get the winning percentage correct, but your results would probably be less "streaky" than an actual sequence of winners. <a href="https://www.football-data.co.uk/blog/Wald_Wolfowitz.php">Joseph Buchdal</a> found that he couldn't create a win-loss record by hand that would fool a statistical test called the Wald-Wolfowitz test, even though he knew exactly how the statistical test works.</p>
<p>Streaks of wins and losses in randomly generated data follow regular mathematical laws, ones our brains don't want to follow when asked to do the exercise. At some level, we're almost physically incapable of generating truly random data, so it makes sense to me that our intuitions about randomness are a little off. Our brains are wired to notice the streaks, but we seem to have no such circuitry for noticing when something is a little bit too un-streaky. Our brains are too quick to see meaningless patterns in small amounts of data, and not clever enough to see subtle, meaningful patterns in large amounts of data. Good thing we have statistics to help us.</p>                    </article>
