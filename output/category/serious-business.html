<p>When NBA superstar Kevin Durant left the Oklahoma City Thunder to join the Golden State Warriors, he said that doing so was taking "the hardet road". This was met with a lot of mockery, because the Golden State Warriors had won 73 games, the most in NBA history, the previous year.</p>
<p>It was widely regarded as an uncool move, the ultimate bandwagon riding. It was clearly an absurd thing to say in basketball terms. It also made the NBA less interesting for several years.</p>
<p>What people missed was that from a geological perspective, it was a totally reasonable things to say. Streets are made with asphalt, which is a combination of local rocks (the substrate) and tar. That means that some regions of America have harder roads than others, based on the local substrate used:</p>
<p><img alt="taken from https://www.forconstructionpros.com/equipment/worksite/article/10745911/aggregate-hardness-map-of-the-united-states" src="/img/aggregate-map.jpg"></p>
<p>Oklahoma City is located right in the center of Oklahoma, with some of the softest substrate in the United States. It's totally reasonable for someone who prefers a harder road to want to leave for somewhere else.</p>
<p>If you look at the map, the "hardest road" at that time would've been to go to New Orleans. It's about a 700 mile drive, and looks like it's a nice gradient from some of the softest roads in the United States to the hardest. The New Orleans Pelicans at the time were <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NOP/2016.html">pretty bad</a>, basically just Anthony Davis, a couple good role players (Ryan Anderson, Jrue Holiday), and a rich collection of "Let's Remember Some Guys" Guys (Jimmer Fredette, Nate Robinson, Luke Babbitt, Ish Smith, Norris Cole). </p>
<p>KD and AD on the same team would have been cool, but even with Kevin Durant, that team would likely have been pretty bad. Certainly worse than the OKC team that he was leaving at the time. Although technically the "hardest road", going to New Orleans might have been a bad basketball idea.</p>
<p>We can see that Northern California has medium-hard substrate, so going to the Warriors was definitely a harder road than a lot of other places in the NBA</p>                    </article>
